# Epithet Generator

Create a Flask API to serve random epithets from the [Shakespeare Insult Kit]

In this sprint, we have defined a function named configure_app in the __init__.py file, imported os, dotenv, and flask within this function, defined environment variables, and instantiated an instance of Flask.  

Then, in the app.py file, we have imported that app instance from the __init__ file and defined a '/' and '/vocabulary' route to serve data (which will be further fleshed out in future sprints)
