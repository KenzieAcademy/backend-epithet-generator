Epithet Generator
In this sprint, we have defined a function named configure_app in the init.py file, imported os, dotenv, and flask within this function, defined environment variables, and instantiated an instance of Flask.

Then, in the app.py file, we have imported that app instance from the init file and defined a '/' and '/vocabulary' route to serve data (which will be further fleshed out in future sprints)
